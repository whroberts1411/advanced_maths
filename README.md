# advanced_maths
 
Amended slightly from the maths_garden demonstration website created as part of the 
Udemy Data Science and Machine Learning course. While the maths is (very) basic,
the site is driven by an image-recognition machine learning module (using TensorFlow)
that reads and interprets the numeric character written on the web page, using a mouse.
